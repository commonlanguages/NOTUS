										<h1>About</h1>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/aboutpic.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>I am Lawrence Yeh, a Canada-based professional with a background in medical device quality assurance, regulatory affairs, public health, and civil engineering. I am currently working as a Senior Policy Analyst for the COVID-19 pandemic response in Ontario.</p>

									<h2>A Pandemic Response</h2>
									<p>Two major factors led me to my current role. First, it could be said that I was predisposed to work on something related to biosecurity or global health pandemics. My career plans at the time - having been informed by effective altruism (EA) and the 80,000 hours community - had identified global catastrophic biological risks as a cause area that was of interest to me. It so happened that I had a few work experiences adjacent to healthcare, so there was some feasibility, although based on my research it seemed that most roles required more targeted education. </p>
									<p>The second factor was related to a sudden onset of one of those global biological risks that I had read about. It was mid-2020, and the intensity of COVID-19 was escalating. Like many, I watched the counts of confirmed cases and deaths skyrocket, and felt a sense of duty to help in a direct way. Thus there was a possibility to have a positive impact on a very large number of people and reduce a great amount of suffering. Indeed, in this role I have helped hundreds of thousands of individuals determine if they can safely continue on with work, school, and see their loved ones. This work has helped to temporarily overcome some systemic healthcare gaps such as a lack of equity and access to care.</p>

									<h2>Beyond the Horizon</h2>
									<p>This role has mutated as the pandemic landscape changed, and the current mission is to improve the biosecurity infrastructure and enable a better response to future pandemics or crises like Antimicrobial Resistance. A vast array of opportunities are ripe for exploration - broad-spectrum testing, genetic sequencing, advanced PPE, pandemic response plans developed with risk management and tested by tabletop simulations, incorporating lessons learned from COVID-19, revisiting the risk-benefit analysis of temporary suspensions of regulatory controls and other emergency responses, and the list goes on. There are some improvements that could be implemented throughout the sector as well, such as clarifying roles and responsibilities amongst healthcare stakeholders and improving institutional decision-making to ensure sound, evidence-based and risk-managed actions - all worthwhile endeavours in my estimation.</p>
